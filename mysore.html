       The<b> Mysore Palace</b> is a historical palace and the royal residence at Mysore in the <b>Indian State of Karnataka</b>.
       It is the official residence of the <b>Wadiyar dynasty</b> and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore,
       and faces the <i>Chamundi Hills</i> eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the<b> 'City of Palaces'</b>, and there are seven palaces 
       including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the <b>Old fort</b>.
       The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as<i> puragiri</i> (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort.
       <i> Yaduraya</i> built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times. 
       The current structure was constructed between <b>1897</b> and <b>1912</b>, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze.
       Mysore Palace is now one of the most <b>famous tourist attractions in India</b>, after the <b>Taj Mahal</b>, with more than 6 million annual visitors.</p>
